### Libraries Used

## Technologies

1. [MVVM-C](https://www.marcosantadev.com/mvvmc-with-swift/): 
   Model-View-ViewModel-Coordinator architecture pattern to separate concerns and improve maintainability and testability.

2. [RxSwift](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift): 
   Framework for reactive programming in Swift, enabling composition and transformation of asynchronous data streams.

3. [Coordinator pattern](https://github.com/quickbirdstudios/XCoordinator): 
   Design pattern to manage navigation logic, keeping view controllers free from navigation-related code.

4. [DifferenceKit](https://github.com/ra1028/DifferenceKit): 
   High-performance library for efficient data change detection, enabling smooth updates to UI components.

5. [Moya/Reactive](https://github.com/Moya/Moya): 
   Network abstraction layer built on Alamofire, integrated with RxSwift for declarative and reactive network calls.

6. [Kingfisher](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher): 
   Powerful library for asynchronous image downloading and caching, enhancing app performance and user experience.

7. [Resolver](https://github.com/hmlongco/Resolver): 
   Lightweight dependency injection framework for Swift, promoting loose coupling and modular code.
